# Factors Linked to Mortality

Statistics project required for course **STA 108 Analysis of Regression** at the University of California, Davis .

## Purpose
This report will analyze the relation between pollution and mortality using data collected from 60 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) in the United States, obtained from the years 1959 – 1961 [Source: GC McDonald and JS Ayers, “Some applications of the ‘Chernoff Faces’: a technique for graphically representing multivariate data”, in Graphical Representation of Multivariate Data, Academic Press, 1978].

## Summary of Data

The data collected features environmental factors and demographic factors such as:
> **PRECIP**:mean annual precipitation (in inches) <br>
 **EDUC**: median number of school years completed by persons of age 25 or 
       older<br>
 **NONWHITE**: percentage of population in 1960 that is non-white <br>
 **POOR**: percentage of households with annual income under $3000 in 1960 <br>
 **NOX**: relative pollution of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) <br>
 **SO2**: relative pollution potential of Sulphur dioxide (SO2) <br>

***NOTE*** Relative pollution potential is the product of the tons emitted per day per square kilometer as a factor correcting for SMSA dimension and exposure. 
The response variable [MORTALITY] is the age-adjusted mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 people in a population).
